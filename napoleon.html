            The Napoleonic Wars are important events in the European history as these global conflict in many ways. First, due to the Napoleonic 
            Wars, concert of Europe was formed to make sure that no one country can press its claim on other European nations like Napoleon did.
            But more importantly, Napoleonic Wars gave rise to the German nationalism and spread nationalism around Europe. German naitonalsim gave
            rise to the unification of Germany which shook the foundation of the balance of power in Europe. The nationalism in other parts of Europe 
            is also important as it destabilized Austria-Hungarian empire and eventually leading to the World War I. Although nationalism is not the 
            only cause of the World War I, it is hard to deny that nationalism had played an important role in the beginning of the War to end all wars.
            And World War I leads to the World War II which finally brought down the European dominance over the globe and started the bipolar world. 
            So studying the Napoleonic Wars in depth is important to understand the history of Europe after 1815.

            The France's involvement in the American Revolution and the Seven Year's war laid huge burden on the French economy. Tax rate was skyrocketting
            and the government debt was unmanageable. To repay the debt, French King, Louis XVI proposed a new tax for the privileged classes who were not 
            paying the tax. To do this, he summoned the Estates-General, an assembly representing France's clergy, nobility, and middle class. 
            The Estates-General was comprised of three Estates, the First Estate was comprised of clergies, the Second was comprised of nobilities and 
            the Third was comprised of commoners. The problem was that each estate has one vote even though the Third Estate comprised 98% of the 
            France's population. 
            <br>
            The Third Estate asked to fix this issue but the nobilities refused. Furious about the voting procedure, the Third Estate 
            met alone and formally adopted the title of National Assembly. Three days later, most of the clerical deupties and 
            47 liberal nobles joined them. Louis the XVI grudgingly agreed to form a new assembly.
            <br>
            But the rumor spread of the impedning military coup and to protect themselves, Parisians stormed the Bastille fortress to secure gunpowder
            and weapons. <sup><i><a href="#frenchRev1">source</a></i></sup> This is the famous "storming of the Bastille". 
            <br>
            With the support of the people, the National Assembly proposed the <i>Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen.</i>
            The declaration was heavily influenced by American revolution and the the Enlightenment thinkers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
            <br>
            But the Revolution soon took a radical turn and the French nobility tried to mobilize foreign powers to support Louis XVI and restore 
            the <i>ancien regime.</i> The revolutionary leaders formed a new legislative body called the <i>Convention</i> and they executed 
            the King Louis XVI and his wife, Queen Marie Antoinette who was the youngest daughter of Empress Maria Theresea.

                European monarchies were furious of the execution of the King Louis XVI and the National Convention's declaration that it will 
                spread the revolutionary ideas across the continent. Also, "the spread of the revolutionary ideals" encompanied the military 
                occupation of French army which shook the balance of Europe further agitating neighboring nations. <sup><i><a href="#frenchRev3">source</a></i></sup>

                <div style="text-indent: 1%">
                So the First Coalition was formed to put an end to this revolution. But we have to understand that while the 
                First Coalition looked formidable and the future of the new French Republic seemed bleak, the Coalition had many problem of 
                its own and the new French Republic's power should not be underestimated. 
                </div>
                <br>
                Even though the First Coalition was comprised of most of the superpowers in Europe(Great Britain, Prussia, Holy Roman Empire, 
                Spain, Dutch Republic, Portugal, etc), the Coalition lacked coordination and trust with each other. For example, the members of 
                Coalition was more preoccupied with the Partition of Poland and thus could not focus their military power to France. As Catherine
                II moved on to eliminate the Polish independence, Austria had to keep 60,000 men on its northern border to make sure it gets a 
                say on how the third and the last partition of Poland should be done. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition to the rivalries and mistrust within the First Coaltion, the French republic itself had a tremendous military potential
                as well. First, an important reform was occurring in the French army regarding the organization, staff planning, artillery and battle 
                tactics for almost 30 years when the French Revolution occurred and the revolution got rid of the aristocratic hindrances to 
                these reforms. Moreover, the new French Republic issued the <i>lev&eacute;e en masse</i> or mass levy and France drafted 800,000 men 
                within a year. Finally, at least in this point of the revolution, there were many soldiers and citizens in the First Coalition who were symphathetic 
                of the revolutionary ideals. Although these symphaties turned into hostilities as France demanded the "liberated regions" to pay for 
                the war, still at this point, French armies could gather support from the locals.

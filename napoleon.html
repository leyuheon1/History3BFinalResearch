            The Napoleonic Wars are important events in the European history as these global conflict in many ways. First, due to the Napoleonic 
            Wars, concert of Europe was formed to make sure that no one country can press its claim on other European nations like Napoleon did.
            But more importantly, Napoleonic Wars gave rise to the German nationalism and spread nationalism around Europe. German naitonalsim gave
            rise to the unification of Germany which shook the foundation of the balance of power in Europe. The nationalism in other parts of Europe 
            is also important as it destabilized Austria-Hungarian empire and eventually leading to the World War I. Although nationalism is not the 
            only cause of the World War I, it is hard to deny that nationalism had played an important role in the beginning of the War to end all wars.
            And World War I leads to the World War II which finally brought down the European dominance over the globe and started the bipolar world. 
            So studying the Napoleonic Wars in depth is important to understand the history of Europe after 1815.

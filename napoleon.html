                The Napoleonic Wars are important events in the European history that changed the course of the 
                European and global history. First, due to the Napoleonic 
                Wars, Concert of Europe was formed to make sure that no one country can press its claim on other European nations like Napoleon did.
                But more importantly, Napoleonic Wars gave rise to the German nationalism and spread nationalism around Europe. German naitonalsim gave
                rise to the unification of Germany which shook the foundation of the balance of power in Europe. French Revolution 
                and Napoleonic Wars also gave rise to 
                the nationalism in other parts of Europe which destabilized
                the Balkans which eventually led to World War I. Although nationalism is not the 
                only cause of the World War I, it is hard to deny that nationalism had played an important role in the beginning of the World War I.
                And World War I leads to the World War II which finally brought down the European dominance over the globe and started the bipolar world. 
                So studying the Napoleonic Wars in depth is important to understand the history of Europe after 1815.

            France's involvement in the American Revolution and the Seven Year's war laid huge burden on the French economy. The tax rate was skyrocketing
            and the government debt was unmanageable. To repay the debt, French King, Louis XVI proposed a new tax for the privileged classes who were not 
            paying the tax. To do this, he summoned the Estates-General, an assembly representing France's clergy, nobility, and middle class. 
            The Estates-General was comprised of three Estates, the First Estate was comprised of clergies, the Second was comprised of nobilities and 
            the Third was comprised of commoners. The problem was that each estate has one vote even though the Third Estate comprised 98% of the 
            France's population. 
            <br>
            The Third Estate asked to fix this issue but the nobilities refused. Furious about the voting procedure, the Third Estate 
            met alone and formally adopted the title of National Assembly. Three days later, most of the clerical deputies and 
            47 liberal nobles joined them. Louis the XVI grudgingly agreed to form a new assembly.
            <br>
            But the rumor spread of the impending military coup and to protect themselves, Parisians stormed the Bastille fortress to secure gunpowder
            and weapons. <sup><i><a href="#frenchRev1">source</a></i></sup> This is the famous "storming of the Bastille". 
            <br>
            With the support of the people, the National Assembly proposed the <i>Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen.</i>
            The declaration was heavily influenced by the American revolution and the Enlightenment thinkers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
            <br>
            But the Revolution soon took a radical turn and the French nobility tried to mobilize foreign powers to support Louis XVI and restore 
            the <i>ancien regime.</i> The revolutionary leaders formed a new legislative body called the <i>Convention</i> and they executed 
            King Louis XVI and his wife, Queen Marie Antoinette who was the youngest daughter of Empress Maria Theresa.

                European monarchies were furious of the execution of the King Louis XVI and the National Convention's declaration that it will 
                spread the revolutionary ideas across the continent. Also, "the spread of the revolutionary ideals" encompanied the military 
                occupation of French army which shook the balance of Europe further agitating neighboring nations. <sup><i><a href="#frenchRev3">source</a></i></sup>

                So the First Coalition was formed to put an end to this revolution. But we have to understand that while the 
                First Coalition looked formidable and the future of the new French Republic seemed bleak, the Coalition had many problem of 
                its own and the new French Republic's power should not be underestimated. 
                </div>
                <br>
                <div style="text-indent: 1%;">
                Even though the First Coalition was comprised of most of the superpowers in Europe(Great Britain, Prussia, Holy Roman Empire, 
                Spain, Dutch Republic, Portugal, etc), the Coalition lacked coordination and trust with each other. For example, the members of 
                Coalition was more preoccupied with the Partition of Poland and thus could not focus their military power to France. As Catherine
                II moved on to eliminate the Polish independence, Austria had to keep 60,000 men on its northern border to make sure it gets a 
                say on how the third and the last partition of Poland should be done.

                <div style="text-indent: 1%;">
                In addition to the rivalries and mistrust within the First Coaltion, the French republic itself had a tremendous military potential
                as well. First, an important reform was occurring in the French army regarding the organization, staff planning, artillery and battle 
                tactics for almost 30 years when the French Revolution occurred and the revolution got rid of the aristocratic hindrances to 
                these reforms. Moreover, the new French Republic issued the <i>lev&eacute;e en masse</i> or mass levy and France drafted 800,000 men 
                within a year. Finally, at least in this point of the revolution, there were many soldiers and citizens in the First Coalition who were symphathetic 
                of the revolutionary ideals. Although these symphaties turned into hostilities as France demanded the "liberated regions" to pay for 
                the war, still at this point, French armies could gather support from the locals.

                During this war, Napoleon showed how he could inspire his men to fight for him to the end risking their own lives.
                His charisma, along with his strategical and tactical brilliance was one of his greatest talents and was important on his 
                success. 
                At the Battle of Lodi, Napoleon ordered his men to cross the bridge occupied by the Austrians. Austrians fired artillery and muskets 
                on the marching French armies and the attack stalled for a moment but Napoleon inspired them to keep pushing. Finally the French 
                army successfully crossed the bridge and with the help of the reinforcement, Napoleon and his men could win the battle.

                <div style="text-indent: 1%;">
                The War of First Coalition came to an end with the Peace of Campo Formio where Austria acknowledged most of the territorial gains 
                France had made. But the peace did not last 
                long as Austria was reluctant in handing over the territories to France and France was asking more than they agree at Campo Formio.

                    The War of Second Coalition started with the French aggression. But again, the Coalition suffered with lack of 
                    coordination and cooperation. Russia and Austria failed to cooperate in the defense of Switzerland and Prussia 
                    did not join the Coalition.

                <div style="text-indent: 1%;">
                    Napoleon exhibited his strategical brilliance during the War of Second Coalition. He moved his troop to trick enemey 
                    into believing that Napoleon will attack Germany. Also, Napoleon ordered Massena to distract the Austrian armies. 
                    While the Austrian armies were attacking Massena in Genoa, Napoleon moved his troops through the Alps. Then he defeated 
                    the surprised Austrians at the Battle of Marengo. Soon after, Moreau defeated the Austrians at Hohenlinden and Vienna 
                    was under threat of direct assault by the French army. Thus, the Austrians had to sue for peace.

                    In the War of Second Coalition and the First, French and British faced the same dilemma. While France reigned supreme 
                    on land and Britain had an unquestionable control at the sea, neither could beat each other in each other's realm. 
                    For France to definitively end the war, it had to send its soldiers over the Channel but such operation was impossible 
                    as British Royal Navy had a firm control in the sea. At the same time, British redcoats could not overwhelm Grande 
                    Arm&eacute;e without the full support of other countries yet Russians had already left the war and Austrians succumbed 
                    to the French might so Britain had no continental ally to rely on. The British merchants were growing tired of the 
                    continued war and they urged the British government to sue for peace. Finally, the two countries signed the treaty at 
                    Amiens (March 1802). <sup><i><a href="#frenchRev5">source</a></i></sup>

                The peace did not last long and war resumed. During this war, Napoleon showed his best strategical and tactical maneuvers 
                at the Battle of Austerlitz or the Battle of Three Emperors. Many historically important events occured during this war.
                First of all, France sold Louisiana to United States. This allowed United States to expand rapidly westward and become 
                a country bodering the Pacific and the Atlantic ocean. Also the Holy Roman Empire was formally dissolved after this war. 
                Holy Roman Empire, the empire that was neither holy nor Roman nor an empire was already falling bit by bit after the War of 
                First and Second Coalition. By the Treaty of Lun&eacute;vile, small German states that were part of the Holy Roman Empire 
                were merged to other bigger German states in order for Napoleon to more effectively control this area. And after the Battle 
                of Austerlitz, emperor Francis II was forced to sign the humiliating Treaty of Pressburg which ended the Habsburg dominance 
                in German affairs. Finally on August 6th, 1806, Francis II stepped down from the throne of the Holy Roman Empire. Ironically,
                the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire sow the seed of the German unification.<sup><i><a href="#frenchRev6">source</a></i></sup>

                France's total dominance over the continent enabled Napoleon to impose <i>"Continental Blockade"</i> on Britain. 
                Napoleon banned all countries under his influence from trading with Britain and this almost brought Britain to 
                her knees. But unfortunately for Napoleon, Britain was undergoing the industrial revolution and thus could 
                withstand Napoleon's blockade much better than the emperor had thought. Also, Napoleon's decision to overthrow 
                the Bourbon dyansty and implement his brother Joseph Bonaparte as the new king of Spain was extremely unpopular 
                among Spaniards. Spain was now in open rebellion against Napoleon. This meant that not only Napoleon had to deal 
                with the guerillas in Spain but also relieved the economic burden that was mounting in Britain due to the Continental 
                Blockade. Furthermore French casualties were mounting. By the time Napoleon led 600,000 men to Russia, only 270,000 
                of them were French. This was okay at the early, successful stage of the campaign but became important during the retreat
                when soldiers started to desert. Finally, although not many states could go for an open rebellion like Spain but still 
                they were resentful about Napoleon's harsh implementation of Continental Blockade, mass conscription and high taxation. 
                When Napoleon came back from Russia, these states were in an open rebellion like Spain. The eventual downfall of 
                Napoleon and his empire left a lasting legacy in European geopolitics. French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars spread 
                nationalism across Europe and also resulted in European powers to seek stability for the first half of the 19th century.

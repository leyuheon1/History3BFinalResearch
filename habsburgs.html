                    I have mentioned in the previous section that Ferdinand and Isabella's marriage and their daughter's marriage with the Habsburg 
                    family have changed the geopolitical landscape of Europe. Ferdinand and Isabella's marriage resulted in the union of the 
                    Kingdom of Aragon and Castille. Their daughter's marriage with Charles resulted in the Habsburg control of 
                    Spain, Burgundy, Naples, Sicily, and Austria along
                    with Spain's vast overseas colonies. Charles became the 
                    emperor of the Holy Roman Empire after his paternal grandfather Maximilian I in 1519
                    and with the death of the King Louis of Hungary at the battle of Mohacs in 1526 Charles claimed the crowns of both Hungary and Bohemia.
                    No one was closer to the unification of Europe since the Charlemagne. <sup><i><a href="#cit1">source1</a></i></sup>

                    But there were numerous problems that prevented Habsburgs from uniting Europe under one central government like Ming China or 
                    the Ottoman empire. First was that simply the regions controlled by Habsburgs were too different from each other and did not share 
                    the sense of unity to be effectively ruled under one central government. Also, Habsburg's rise in Europe agitated too many European powers. The Turks were aggressively expanding in the East, sometimes
                    even laying siege to Vienna, the heart of the empire. The Barbary pirates were raiding the coast of Spain. English fleet and the privateers
                    like Francis Drake were disrupting Spanish trade with its overseas colonies. The Reformation further added to these hardships as German princes used the new Religious movement to gain autonomy from the 
                    Vienna. Also, the Dutch Protestants were in full revolt. The rival nations support to these rebel movements made it harder for 
                    Habsburg monarchs to quell the rebellion. England was helping the Dutch rebel and France supported the Protestant German princes 
                    (even though France itself was a Catholic country) during the Thirty year's war. <sup><i><a href="#cit2">source2</a></i></sup>

                    Simply put, the empire was overstretched.

                        The Thirty Years war and resulting treaties finally marked the end of the Habsburg dominance of Europe. 
                        The stage was set when the Protestant Union was formed in 1608 and as a result, the Catholic League was founded
                        in 1609 to counter the Union. The revolt of the Protestant estates of Bohemia in 1618 sparked the war.

                        The Spanish Habsburg and the Austrian Habsburg fought well. The Habsburg was on the brink of quelling the rebellion
                        with its brilliant general Wallenstein.
                        But once again the European habit of resisting a single dominant power in the continent comes into play. 
                        As Habsburg came ever closer to crushing the rebels, France and Sweden directly intervened.
                        The Habsburgs could not resist the coalition and had to sign the peace treaty at Westphalia, acknowledging the 
                        freedom to choose their own religion for the German princes. Also, the treaty stripped Habsburgs of Netherlands and 
                        Switzerland. Even after the Peace of Westphalia, Spain fought against France. France was supported by England and could 
                        deliver a crushing blow to the Spanish army. The Spanish Habsburgs had to sign a peace treaty which is now remembered as 
                        the Treaty of Pyrenees(1659). Although the terms were not harsh, the treaty marked the end of the Habsburg dominance in Europe.

            Thomas Nipperdy starts his famous book about the German history with this line. One of the lasting legacies of Napoleon 
            was the rise of German nationalism. Before the Napoleonic Wars, "Germany" was divided into hundreds of independent states sharing 
            little sense of national identity.

            But Napoleon reorganized these German states into 39 larger states and established the Confederation of the Rhine which were 
            comprised of 16 German states. Moreover, the German elites realized that they cannot protect themselves from foreign powers 
            if they did not support each other. So the German princes encouraged nationalistic feelings among the German population.

            After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, German states formed the German Confederation which seek to protect its member states. 
            Furthermore, as the industrial revolution gained pace, German entrepreneurs asked to abolish the tarrif barriers to 
            maximize their profits. Thus, the Zollverin or the Customs Union was formed under the Prussian leadership in 1834. This 
            further stimulated the sense of unity among German nations.

                The rise of nationalism was not restricted to German states. Pan-Slavism was rising in the eastern and east central Europe 
                where Austria-Hungarian empire and Ottoman empire used to rule. Pan-Slavic movement further eroded the already waning 
                Austrian-Hungarian empire and the Ottoman empire. Also the Pan-Slavic movement encouraged Russia to form a close relationship 
                with Slavic nations such as Serbia and this was one of the reason why World War I became the "World War" instead of a locally 
                contained military conflict. <sup><i><a href="#cit4">source4</a></i></sup>

          In the Iberian peninsula, the Spain has finally driven out the last 
          remnant of the Muslim forces from Granada in the year 1492. 
          The Reconquista was finally accomplished.
          The two monarchs, Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile,
          are very important because not only they united the whole Iberian peninsula
          but also they sponsored Columbus's voyage.<sup><i><a href="#allSource">source</a></i></sup> Moreover, their daughter, Joanna of Castile, married
          the Habsburg prince, Philip I of Habsburg. This led to the golden age of the Habsburg dynasty when
          the Habsburg family ruled Spain, Austria, Hungary, significant part of Italy, and Netherlands at 
          same time.
          But for now, we focus on the Columbus's voyage to the Americas.
          <br>
          Columbus's "discover of the New World" is a significant moment in the human history. First of all,
          a lot of new foods like potatoes and red pepper from the Americas were imported to the Eurasian continent.
          Korean Kimchi would have looked very different without the red pepper from the Americas. <sup><i><a href="#ColumbianExchangeFood">source</a></i></sup> 
          <br>
          Also, Columbus's discovery of the New World and eventaul discovery of the  
          silver mines in the Americas changed the existing global trade mechanism and the geopolitics in Europe.
          Ming China used the paper money as its currency but soon people were producing counterfeit bills and the government
          could not stop that. So the government had to shift its currency from paper money to bimetallic coin of gold and silver
          Thus, Ming China was in dire need of silver supply to "print out" all the money. At the same time,
          Spain was literally drowned in silver as excess supply of silver was driving up the inflation in Spain.
          Plus the Spain wanted the manufactured goods from China. So the silver from the Americas flowed into Spain and then 
          to China while the manufactured goods from China flowed to Spain.

        But Columbus and his successors had commited horrible atrocities. They enslaved thousands of natives forcing them to work in the 
        silver mines with terrible conditions. Also, the conquistadors brought in numerous diseases from the Old World which killed millions 
        of Native Americans. Finally, after the labor became scarce due to disease and massacres, Columbus and his successors brought slaves from 
        Africa. This is why we should learn about the Columbus's voyage and its signficance in history but not consider him as some kind of a hero.
        (Plus he's not the one to discover the New World as vikings have done it 5 centuries earlier than him)

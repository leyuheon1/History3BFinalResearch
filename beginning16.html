              In the Iberian peninsula, Spain has finally driven out the last 
              remnant of the Muslim forces from Granada in the year 1492. 
              The Reconquista was finally accomplished.
              The two monarchs, Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile,
              are very important because not only they united the whole Iberian peninsula
              but also they sponsored Columbus's voyage. Moreover, their daughter, Joanna of Castile, married
              the Habsburg prince, Philip I of Habsburg. This led to the golden age of the Habsburg dynasty when
              the Habsburg family ruled Spain, Austria, Hungary, significant part of Italy, and Netherlands at the 
              same time.
              But for now, we focus on the Columbus's voyage to the Americas.<sup><i><a href="#SpanishMariage">source1</a></i></sup>

            Columbus's "discovery of the New World" is a significant moment in the human history. First of all,
            a lot of new foods like potatoes and red pepper from the Americas were imported to the Eurasian continent.
            Korean Kimchi would have looked very different without the red pepper from the Americas. <sup><i><a href="#ColumbianExchangeFood">source2</a></i></sup>

            Also, Columbus's discovery of the New World brought in a lot of silver from the New World which 
            was then exported to Ming China. Ming China used paper currency but because of excess issuance of paper monies, 
            the currency became almost useless. Thus, people started using silver as the main currency for business and slowly, the 
            government adopted silver coins as well. So, Ming China was in dire need of silver 
            and Spain was drowned in silver. Silver started to flow from Americas into Spain and then 
            to China while the manufactured goods from China flowed to Spain. The naval trade between Spain and Ming China can be considered as 
            the early form of globalization.<sup><i><a href="#cit3">source3</a></i></sup>

            But Columbus and his successors had commited horrible atrocities. They enslaved thousands of natives forcing them to work in the 
            silver mines with terrible conditions. Also, the conquistadors brought in numerous diseases from the Old World which killed millions 
            of Native Americans. Finally, after the labor became scarce due to disease and massacres, Columbus and his successors brought slaves from 
            Africa. This is why we should learn about the Columbus's voyage and its signficance in history but not consider him as some kind of a hero.
            (Plus he's not the one to discover the New World as vikings have done it 5 centuries earlier than him) <sup><i><a href="#cit4">source4</a></i></sup>

                    The Napoleonic Wars left a deep scar in Europe. 2.5 million soldiers and 1 million civilians were killed. 
                    So the one thing that all European monarchs agreed upon at the Congress of Vienna was to restore stability in Europe. 
                    Restoring and maintaining the balance of Europe was the most important agenda fro European leaders. That is why 
                    France was saved from harsh treatment as European monarchs did not want to risk further destabilizing France which 
                    could result in another revolution. So the adventurist diplomacy which might result in another war was frowned upon and 
                    most nations strived to maintain the status quo. 
                    In this sense, the Austria-Hungarian empire was vital in maintaing the "peace" in Europe as the Habsburgs could 
                    check the French power in the west and contain the Prussian expansionists from altering the balance of power in Europe 
                    and Britain and Russia supported the Habsburgs in maintaing the status quo.

                    But the rise of nationalism soon proved that no matter how Metternich and the Habsburgs strived, the status quo could 
                    not be maintained and new nations will spring out from multiethnic empires. Although the Habsburgs could crush the 
                    revolutionary movements during the first half of the 19th century with the support of Russian czar, its repeated use of 
                    violence against the people asking for self-determination angered Britain and further stimulated the revolutionary fervors 
                    among all class in Italy. <sup><i><a href="#cit3">source3</a></i></sup>

                    More importantly, the nationalism was spreading in Germany and the German Nationalism brought some questions with it.
                    Should the new "Germany" include the kingdom of Austria? Who should be the leader of the German states, Prussia or 
                    Austria? Although some German nationalists and old Prussian conservatives were symphathetic to the Austria-Hungarian empire,
                    Austria-Hungarian empire was consisted of significant non-German minorities. Also the Austria-Hungarian empire could not join 
                    the Zollverein, the German Customs Union, due to domestic merchants asking for protectionist policies. <sup><i><a href="#cit4">source4</a></i></sup>

                    But still, during the first half of the 19th century, Prussia was clearly not in a position to bid for the mastery in Germany.
                    Prussia did not have military or diplomatic capabilities to overwhelm Austria-Hungary. For example, when the elector of Hesse 
                    in the autumn of 1850 asked military support against the rebellions, Austria and Prussia both sent troops to the region. 
                    The two armies were about to clash but Russia stepped in and sided with Austria. Thus, Prussia had to withdraw and accept the 
                    agreement signed at Olm&uuml;tz which thwarthed the Prussian plan of German unification excluding Austria. <sup><i><a href="#cit5">source5</a></i></sup>
                    Furthermore, Prussia was lacking in industrial output compared to Britain, France, and Austria-Hungary and 
                    its politics were divided between its liberal western part and conservative eastern part which were disconnected to each 
                    other. <sup><i><a href="#cit6"></a></i></sup>

                The things started to change, though, in the second half of the century. Russia had to focus on recovering from the humiliation 
                of Crimean war and Britain chose to focus on its oversea colonies and domestic issues. Thus, it became much more easier for Prussia
                to overturn the balance of power agreed on the Congress of Vienna. Furthermore, the industrial revolution was now directly affecting
                the military and Prussia, thanks to its Prussian General Staff, adopted new 
                weapons like fast loading rifles and breech loading, mobile artilleries and systems like railways faster than their rivals. The conscription system that required three years' obligatory service in the regular 
                army and then to serve as Landwehr(militas guarding their hometown) for four years meant that Prussia could maintain a huge army 
                relative to its population. This conscription system was possible because of its educational system which was considered the best 
                in Europe. For mass conscription to work, the country should have a lot of men who could read and write and Prussia had one of the 
                highest literacy rate in Europe. Moreover Germany was already catching up with other industrial powers and by the time of 
                Franco-Prussian War, the population of the whole "Germany" was larger than France and German states possessed more miles of railway.
                Disunity had tricked people into believing that France and Austria-Hungary will win against the Prussians but in reality, 
                the combined German states were already stronger compared to France or Austria-Hungary. <sup><i><a href="cit7">source7</a></i></sup> <sup><i><a href="cit8"></a></i></sup>

                On top of those changes, brilliance of Bismarck and Moltke the Elder led to German unificaiton. Bismarck made sure Prussia 
                does not face more than one enemy at a time. In 1864, Bismarck made an alliance with Austria and attacked Denmark to gain 
                control of Schleswig-Holstein. Bismarck promised to hand over Holstein to Austria. Prussia won the war and gained control 
                of Schleswig. But two years latter, Prussia went to a war with Austria and this time, Bismarck made sure no country will 
                come to help Austria. Britain was preoccupied with domestic and overseas issues and Russia was angered by Austrian support 
                of the anti-Russian alliance. Moltke with the support of the General Staff overwhelmed Austrian army within several weeks.
                Bismarck's true genius was knowing when to stop. Prussian King wanted to push further and capture Vienna but Bismarck 
                insisted that Prussia should not venture too far as other countries might intervene and Prussia had already gained the 
                dominance over the <i>German Question</i>. Prussia formed the North German Confederation which was the union of the 
                German states north of the Main River in 1867.
                Now, only the southern German states such as Bavaria and W&uuml;rttemberg were left to be "unified." 
                The opportunity came when Spain offered its throne to Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. As his name suggests,
                Prince Leopold was related to the Hohenzollern, the Prussian royal family and Bismarck urged him to accept the offer.
                However, France stepped in and Prince Leopold and Spain had to step back. Bismarck used this as an opportunity to wage 
                war against France and unite the remaining southern states. Once again the superior mobility, organization and General 
                Staff gave Germany a swift victory. On 18 January 1871, the German empire proclaimed its unification in the Hall of 
                Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. <sup><i><a href="#cit9">source9</a></i></sup> <sup><i><a href="#cit10">source10</a></i></sup> <sup><i><a href="#cit11">source11</a></i></sup>

                German unification shook the balance of power in Europe and Bismarck knew that he should not further 
                agitate the European powers. Bismarck did his best to make sure that no coalition is formed against the 
                new German Empire and made alliances with Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. But all of this will come to an end 
                in the decades after Bismarck retires. <sup><i><a href=""></a></i></sup>

                    The peace treaty at Versailles laid heavy burden on Germany. Although not much territorial changes had been made compared to 
                    other Central Powers, Germany had to pay a huge sum of money as a reparations. Also, there was resentment prevalent among 
                    Germans of the abrupt surrender. It was hard for Germans to accept the reality that their proud country had to surrender 
                    when they controlled vast amount of lands stretching from Belgium to Ukraine. The reparations, which were worth $296 billion 
                    today, fueled the German anger against the Allies. On top of that the economic crisis during the interwar period destabilized 
                    German politics and increased the popularity of Nazis. With Nazis controlling the German politics, Germany rapidly rearmed 
                    itself and went back to an aggressive expansionist policies.

                    Another problem was brewing in the East. Japanese empire had beccome an industrial giant and its 
                    industrial production had already surpassed that of France. But Japan's industry heavily depended on 
                    imports from regions it had conquered or from foreign trades. Japanese steel industry required large amount of
                    pig iron and coal from China. Japan also had to import almost all of its pertoleum fuels. With the increase 
                    of protectionist policies around the globe where each superpower was building its own bloc of economy,
                    Japanese elites were getting concerned of the country's lack of natural resources. Furthermore, 
                    the military was getting more and more poltical powers. The military was spending 31 percent of the 
                    government spending in 1931-1932 and 47 percent of the government spending in 1936-1937. When 
                    the finance minstry under Takahashi tried to stop this trend, he was assassinated by the militarists. 
                    Finally, the Japanese military thought that the reason that China could fight against Japan for so long 
                    is because of the economic support of the West which came through Burma Road and French Indochina. 
                    The Japanese Navy and eventually the Army concluded that the clash with Britain, France, and America was inevitable.

                German aggression started with the remilitarization of the Rhineland on March, 7, 1936. Today, people wonder why 
                the democratic nations in the West(UK, France, and USA) did not step into stop Hitler. First, Britains, French and 
                Americans were tired of the World War I and wanted to prevent next major war at all cost. But more importantly, 
                these democratic nations could not coordinate their policies to contain German aggression becuase of the internal turmoils 
                in the interwar period. US economy had been hit hard by the Great Depression. Britain and France were disunited and 
                did not like each other's approach to Germany and Italy and Hitler took full advantage of this situation. 
                After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, Nazi Germany annexed Austria on March 13, 1938. Then he went on to annex 
                Sudentland, the German speaking region of Czechoslovakia on September 30, 1938. Eventually, Hitler annexed rest of 
                Czechoslovakia in March, 1939. Then, the Nazi Germnay and the Soviet Union signed Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the non-aggression 
                pact between the two countries on August 23, 1939. Finally, Hitler invaded Poland, on September 1, 1939.

                    German generals had far better understanding of the modern technologies and how to utilize them in the battlefield compared 
                    to their French counterparts. While the French generals believed that the superior firepower is the key to victory, German 
                    generals realized that speed is the key to the modern warfare and that the tank divisons should be utilized independently from 
                    the infantry divisions to maximize its speed. The key to this new warfare or <i>Blitzkreig</i> was the speed and concentration. Although only 
                    15 percent of the Germany army was mechanized, German divisions could numerically outnumber their enemies thanks to the 
                    concentration of their forces at the weakest part of the enemey line. Flexibility of German decision making system
                    was also vital in Blitzkreig. German army employed mission-type tactics where the emphasis is on the outcome of a mission 
                    rather than the specific ways of achieving it. So if the commander figures out that alternative route of attack is preferrable,
                    he or she could order the troop to attack through different route without having to go through the chain of command. 
                    Thus, German military could exploit the weakness in enemy line better than the French. Finally, the use of modern technologies,
                    like radios and airplanes helped Germans a lot. Germany used dive bombers as fast moving artilleries which could support the 
                    panzers. Also, while the French relied most of its communication through telephone lines, German troops used radios for 
                    communication. Thus, when the Panzer divisions made a breakthrough in French lines, encircle the French army and 
                    cut the telephone lines in the rear, French troops panicked. With the use of this new tactics, German troops could 
                    overwhelm their French counterparts and France fell on June, 1940.

                    But because of the body of water that is blocking Great Britain from German Blitzkreig, Germany 
                    could not deploy the same tatic against Great Britain. Slowly the war was changing into the war of attrition. 
                    Germany's decision to attack the Soviet Union amplified the problem as USSR had much superior industrial capacity
                    compared to Nazi Germany. Also, the Red Army adopted the German tactics and was deploying much more 
                    tanks compared to the Wehrmacht. Finally, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor dragged US into the war and sealed
                    the fate of the Facists.

                    Europe was devastated by the two world wars. Slowly the European colonies gained independence.
                    On the other hand, United States of America and the Soviet Union became the two global powers who would 
                    dictacte the future of humanity for 50 years. This is where our journey ends. 
                    Starting with the Columbus's voyage, Europe could exert influence over the world for more than 400 years.
                    But after the two horrifying world wars, Europe was devastated and could no longer hold on to its 
                    imperialist past.
